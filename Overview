We are building an online grocery store (think Amazon or ebay).

Main sections:
  1) Buyer profile
    *first name, last name, money, password
  2)  Catalogue - currently as a dictionary
    *quantity, price
    
  *Display current store
  *Add items to cart
  *Remove items from cart
  *Display total cost
  *Purchase function/method where inventory is deducted while cart is added.
  ****How to save information to reopen later (SQL?)
